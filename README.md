# Study Tracker
## Project Overview
Study Tracker provides an easy way to visualize your ongoing study tasks and track your progress using color coding (e.g., green indicates a high level of confidence in your knowledge). It personally helped me achieve my goals during my final exams. \
The project implements all the necessary CRUD operations to interact with the database through a simple user interface. It utilizes PHP and MySQL on top of XAMPP for the back end, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.



## What I Learned During This Project

Making this project helped me grasp the basics of back-end development with PHP. It introduced me to all of the various possibilities a website can have, and taught me many valuable skills such as:

* __Dynamically Displaying Content:__ I learned how to dynamically display content on web pages, enabling the interface to update based on user interactions and data changes. This was an important step in making the user experience more responsive and interactive.

* __PDO Connections:__ I learned how to use PHP Data Objects (PDO) to establish flexible and secure connections to the database. PDO allows me to easily switch between different types of databases without having to rewrite a lot of code, enhancing the adaptability of my project.

* __Prepared Statements:__ I gained experience in using prepared statements with unnamed parameters, which improved the security of my SQL queries by preventing SQL injection attacks. 

* __Handling Server Requests:__ I developed the capability to retrieve and handle server request data efficiently. This includes understanding how to manage GET and POST requests, ensuring that the correct data is processed based on user actions. 

* __Exception Handling:__ I learned how to implement exception handling mechanisms to manage errors smoothly. This ensures that the application remains stable in case of issues.
